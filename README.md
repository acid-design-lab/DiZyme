<br>

The DiZyme 2.0 - web-resource for rational design of nanozymes using machine learning algorithms. <br>
It contains a unique expandable database of nanozymes with links to original articles, an
interactive clickable tool for its visualization, and a machine learning models for various levels of user
requests (explorative, detailed and customised) capable of predicting multiple catalytic activity represented as the
Michaelis-Menten (Km, mM) constant with R<sup>2</sup> 0.75 and the maximum reaction rate (Vmax, mM/s) with R<sup>2</sup>
0.77.<br><br>
Nanozymes are a unique class of materials that have already demonstrated a number of useful properties for applications in biomedicine, biosensing, clinical diagnostics, environmental monitoring and beyond. At the same time, the search for new candidates is usually associated with a large amount of tedious experimental work. To simplify experimental screening, we were the first to develop a more convenient, machine learning (ML) driven approach to search for new candidates and released the web platform, called DiZyme.
