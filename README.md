# DiZyme2.0
DiZyme: The Ultimate Resource for Nanozyme Multiple Catalytic Activity Prediction
dizyme.aicidlab.itmo.ru

The DiZyme 2.0 - web-resource for rational design of nanozymes using machine learning algorithms.
It contains a unique expandable database of nanozymes with links to original articles, an interactive clickable tool for its visualization, and a machine learning models for various levels of user requests (explorative, detailed and customised) capable of predicting multiple catalytic activity represented as the Michaelis-Menten (Km, mM) constant with R2 0.72 and the maximum reaction rate (Vmax, mM/s) with R2 0.74.
This resource will facilitate the design and optimization of nanomaterials with the desired catalytic activity and open new frontiers for nanozyme design.
There is machine learning algorithms and optimisation algorithms which were used in project.
